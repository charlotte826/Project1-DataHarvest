### Purpose
Investigate key considerations for a small farmer starting a backyard farm business in an area where it is difficult to buy affordable and good-quality fresh food.

### Outline

2. Challenges: Mitigating increasing environmental unpredictability
3. Profitibility: Identifying high-demand crops and growing methods

### Research Questions
1. What demand can small farmers meet in the food supply chain?
2. What are the current challenges facing small farmers to having profitable, high yield farms?
3. What products can small farmers focus on to increase profitability?
