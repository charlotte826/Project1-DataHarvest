### Purpose
Investigate key considerations for a small farmer starting a backyard farm business in Saratoga County, NY, which is an area where it is difficult to buy affordable and good-quality fresh food.

### Outline
Farmer's key considerations: 
1. Demand: Understanding the farm's surrounding area demographic needs
2. Challenges: Mitigating environmental unpredictability
3. Profitibility: Identifying high-demand crops and growing methods

### Research Questions
1. What demand can small farmers meet in the food supply chain?
2. What are the current challenges facing small farmers to having profitable, high yield farms?
3. What products can small farmers focus on to increase profitability?

### Datasets
* USDA ERA Food Access Dataset: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/download-the-data/
* NASA GISS (Goddard Institute for Space Studies) Surface Temperature: https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/
* PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State University: http://prism.oregonstate.edu/
* USDA Economics, Statistics and Market Information System (ESMIS) dataset of U.S national and state data for acreage, production, utilization, prices, and values for strawberries: https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/8s45q876k?locale=en

*Dataset Access Note: Government shutdown affected accesibilty of government datasets, like NOAA's Climate data

### Findings
#### What demand can small farmers meet in the food supply chain?
* Food deserts are areas where low-income, grocery proximity or transportation access keep affordable and good-quality fresh food out of reach for a significant portion of the population. Our findings show that close-proximity produce grown from small farms is an in-demand solution that meets the needs of those living in these areas. This is especially true for the water-rich Saratoga County, NY area, where growing food and transporting it for sale in water-poor areas will reap major profit for farmers in the near future.

#### What are the current challenges facing small farmers to having profitable, high yield farms?
* A major challenge facing small farmers today is the increasing unpredicitability of the environment. Based on our findings, a controlled environment, like a greenhouse, will be a small farmer's best investment to protect crops and mitigate extreme and unforseeable conditions.

#### What products can small farmers focus on to increase profitability? 
* Our national and local crop analyzation revealed that strawberries and onions may be a NY-based small farmer's best crops to invest in their first year, with organic onions fetching higher prices. These are the top performing crops in terms of revenue in the state. (plots location: Profitibility folder)
